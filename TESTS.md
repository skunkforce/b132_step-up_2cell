# smoke test
## setup
Connectd 2.4v between GND and vin. Measured the voltage between vout and GND.
## results
3.3V


# load test
## setup
Connectd 2.4v between GND and vin. Connected a variable resistor between vout and GND. Measured the voltage between vout and GND.
## results
up to about 20R the output was stable at 3.3V, with higher currents its became unstable and dropped.
