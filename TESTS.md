# smoke test
## setup
Connectd 2.4v between GND and vin. Measured the voltage between vout and GND.
## results
3.3V


# load test
## setup
Connectd 2.4v between GND and vin. Connected a variable resistor between vout and GND. Measured the voltage between vout and GND.
## results
up to about 3R the output was stable, only droping slightly to 3.15v from 3.3v, with higher currents its became unstable and dropped. (the inductor is probably running into saturation. ETQ-P4M4R7YFP will be tested in the future)
